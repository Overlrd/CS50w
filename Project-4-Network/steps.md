# vNew Post: 

Users who are signed in should be able to write a new text-based post by filling in text into a text area and then clicking a button to submit the post.

The screenshot at the top of this specification shows the “New Post” box at the top of the “All Posts” page. You may choose to do this as well, or you may make the “New Post” feature a separate page.mm


# All Posts :
The “All Posts” link in the navigation bar should take the user to a page where they can see all posts from all users, with the most recent posts first.


Each post should include the username of the poster, the post content itself, the date and time at which the post was made, and the number of “likes” the post has (this will be 0 for all posts until you implement the ability to “like” a post later).
